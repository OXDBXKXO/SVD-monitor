# SVD-monitor
This script is not a complete monitor, as it lacks the necessary comparison of newly scraped links with a database.

The goal of the script is to demonstrate use of regex to extract data from page fetched using [got](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got), [node-schedule](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-schedule) for efficient task scheduling and [discord-webhook-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-webhook-node) to report results in a Discord server channel.
