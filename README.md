# SVD-monitor
Monitor new releases on [SVD](http://www.sivasdescalzo.com/en/hot-releases). The script uses regex to extract data from page fetched using [got](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got), [node-schedule](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-schedule) for efficient task scheduling and [discord-webhook-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-webhook-node) to report results in a Discord server channel.
